# Sales-Analysis
In this analysis project we are analysing sales data of 12 month. The data contains hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by month, product type, cost, purchase address, etc.

We answer some key business question to help maximize profits.
The Questions are:
1) What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2) What city sold the most product?
3) What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
4) What products are most often sold together?
5) What product sold the most? 

At last we find if there is a correlation between sales quantity and price of a product.
